# Synopsis
Thanks for purchasing one of the many themes developed using the 
Checkmate Vivus API. This file has been documented to the best of
our knowledge to simplify the development process. This theme assumes
you have basic knowledge in HTML, CSS, Javascript and PHP (at least know
the difference between the files mentioned previously e.g html files end with .html). 

# Get started
To get started simply request your api at  
[Checkmate Vivus](https://www.checkmateconcevoir.com/vivus/login?redirectUrl=interface/home?ei=0&promoter=social) 
and edit the file `php_include/page/required.php` as seen below.

```
$key = "key";
$username = "username";

```

# Personalisation
To personalise the theme edit the file `php_include/page/design.php` and fill in the information you wish to change.

```
// This was made to simply design processes
// Change this section to make changes to
// basic content such as Heading,
// Image, Social links and Adress

$title1 = "Lorem ipsum <br />Dolor"; // First title
$title2 = "This is the official public page of Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet."; // Second title
$title3 = "WHAT A YEAR IT'S BEEN!"; // Third title
$title4 = "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Vivamus semper feugiat tristique. 
Vivamus tellus augue, convallis."; // Intro text
$imglink1 = "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/18581928_810485395770978_4638362919669315621_n.jpg?oh=d1c0f67213b77da84d228148d4ef6326&oe=59DF65DF"; // Introductory image
