# Synopsis

Checkmate Vivus is an events plus social network designed to provide a seamless way of socialising via events. This documentation has been fully documented to our knowledge to help both organisers, attendees, companies and developers get the best experience from our platform. If you need further help in any section please email dev@checkmateconcevoir.com and we would guide you through resolving any issues.

# Getting started
This documentation assumes you already have an API access token or key, if you don't have one login to [Vivus](https://www.checkmateconcevoir.com/vivus/login?redirectUrl=interface/home?ei=0&promoter=social) under setting and access your access token. An example of making a query using php is shown below:

```
    $action = "ActionType";
    $key = "AccessToken";
    $username = "Username";
    
    // example url -> https://www.checkmateconcevoir.com/vivus/interface/API/public/eventlist/key/demo
    $ch = curl_init("https://www.checkmateconcevoir.com/vivus/interface/API/public/$action/$key/$username");
    curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, true);
    $result = curl_exec($ch);
    
    // Set the parameters for arrays
    $id = array();
    $eventname = array();
    $description = array();


    // Clear json file and print it in text format
    // source [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4343596/parsing-json-file-with-php]
    $jsonIterator = new RecursiveIteratorIterator(
    new RecursiveArrayIterator(json_decode($result, TRUE)),
    RecursiveIteratorIterator::SELF_FIRST);

    // Used for looping an other actions as seen below
    // You can remove this section but this was widely
    // implemented by other developers
    $x = 0;

    // Loop through post provided by each outlet
    foreach ($jsonIterator as $key => $val) {
        if(is_array($val)) {} 
        else {
        if($key == "id"){
            array_push($id, $val);
        }
        if($key == "eventname"){
            array_push($eventname, $val);
        }
        if($key == "details"){
            array_push($description, $val);
        }
    }
        // Looping vars
        $x = $x + 1;
    }


    // array size of the news
    $arraySize = sizeof($id);

    // Then loop through them
    for ($x = 0; $x < $arraySize; $x++) {

    // To output results e.g eventname
    echo("<h3>" . $eventname[$x] . "</h3>");
    echo("<p>" . $description[$x] . "</p>");
    
    // Link to the event
    echo("<p><a href='https://www.checkmateconcevoir.com/vivus/interface/eventpage?ei="
    . $id[$x] . "'>Here</a></p>");
    }
    
```

The `$action`, `$key` and `$username` are the key parameters needed to make a successful query:

* `$action` - This variable states what information you may need, more examples:
  - eventlist: To get information of events hosted by you (the user).
  - eventvid: To get url link to videos upload to the Checkmate Vivus.
  - gallery: To get galleries of images uploaded to the Checkmate Vivus.
* `$key` - This is your unique identifier which can be found under settings, for public use you can use 'key' but access may be restricted.
* `$username` - This states whose information you would like to access (in most cases it is the information tailored to your access to token).

If successful the query returns a series of information in json format:

```

    "id": "95",
    "username": "CheckmateVivus",
    "eventname": "Lorem ipsum",
